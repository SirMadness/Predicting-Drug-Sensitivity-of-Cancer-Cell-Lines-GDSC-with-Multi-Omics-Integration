# Executive summary
Precision oncology hinges on matching the right drug to the right tumour profile.  
Using the **Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer II (GDSC 8.5)** screen plus
DNA-methylation, somatic-mutation and gene-expression layers, machine-learning models are trained to predict **log-IC50** values for 278 drugs
across >900 human cancer cell lines.  

The best gradient-boosted tree model (LightGBM) attains **RMSE = üîÑ ŒºM** and
classifies ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù lines with **AUROC = üîÑ** on an **unseen-cell-line**
validation set, demonstrating that multi-omics features improve out-of-sample
accuracy over GDSC features alone.



# Rationale

* Cancer remains on of the leading causes of death globally, costly to treat, and personalized medicine is key to effective treatment.
* Development of therapies is a costly venture. Therefore, reducing development time and resources will help advance new drug candidates through the pipeline.
* Wet-lab dose‚Äìresponse assays cost \$10‚Äì\$40 per compound‚Äìcell-line pair.  
* A predictive **in-silico triage** system focuses experiments on the most promising drug‚Äìtumour pairs, accelerating biomarker discovery and reducing R&D cost.  
* Next-generation sequencing data are now routine; integrating these omics layers into predictive models enables **personalised therapy selection**.



## Objectives 
- Leverage publicly available Genomics of Drug Sensitivity in Cancer (GDSC-II) datasets for training and evaluation of the model.  
  
- Integrate methylation, mutation and expression  datasets, from other publically available sources, with the GDSC II dataset.

- Develop and evaluate machine learning models for predicting the drug log-IC50 for specific cancers, cell types and drugs. 

- Evaluate wether methylation, mutation and/or expression are key features for predicting drug IC50.  

- Evaluate wether utilising the drug-response AUC as the target outperforms ln_ic50 for suppervised learning.

# Research Question
**Can multi-omics features (gene expression, DNA methylation, somatic mutations) improve the prediction of log-IC50 for drugs tested in GDSC when applied to *new, previously unseen* cancer cell lines?**

# Data Sources
The following datasets were downloaded and combined using COSMIC_ID and Drug_id as keys, into a single dataframe ***(merged_df)*** as an input for data understanding and preperation. 

| Layer | File | Rows / Cols | Source |
|-------|------|-------------|--------|
| **Drug response (core)** | `GDSC2_fitted_dose_response_27Oct23.xlsx` | 295 drugs √ó 242 k assays | GDSC 8.5 |
| **Drug annotations** | `screened_compounds_rel_8.5.csv` | 621 | GDSC 8.5 |
| **Cell metadata** | `Cell_Lines_Details.xlsx` | 1001 | GDSC 8.5 |
| DNA-methylation | `GSE68379_Matrix.processed.txt.gz` | 486 k probes | GEO GSE68379 |
| WES mutations | `WES_variants.xlsx` | 486 k genes | GDSC 7.0 |
| Gene expression | `sanger1018_brainarray_ensemblgene_rma.txt.gz` | 18 k genes | GDSC 7.0 |

# Methodology

1. **Data engineering**  
   *Key steps*  
    * Parse omics files, harmonise **COSMIC_ID** and **DRUG_ID** keys  
    * Filter mutation table to 478 curated driver genes; create binary flags  
    * Derive methylation **median** & **std** per cell line (‚Üí 2 features)  
    * PCA-reduce expression to top-100 PCs (80 % variance)  
    * Merge into a single `merged_df` (224 104 rows √ó 1 219 features)  
    * Split 80 / 20 by **COSMIC_ID** (GroupShuffle) ‚áí unseen cell lines in validation  
    * Create confidence weights `w = 1 / (rmse + Œµ)` (top 1 % clipped)

    EDA notebooks (`00_download.ipynb`, `01_eda.ipynb`) show missingness maps,
    lineage distributions and pair-plots of ln-IC50 vs omics summaries.

2. **Data Splitting - Drug-Wise Stratified Unseen Cell Line Split**

3. **Baseline Models** 
For baseline the baseline model an LGBMRegressor was trainined on the core (GDSC) data set only and without weights. For the purpose of comparing regressor with classification models, regression predictions are additionally thresholded at each drug‚Äôs 25% IC50 quantile to compute AUROC / PR-AUC, enabling direct comparison with binary classifiers. This enambled th ecalculation of Accuaryc, Precision, Recall, RMSE, MAE and FBeta.

4. **Model families evaluated**

    In this sudy, a series of regression (2), classificaiton (2) and deep learning (1) models will be evaluate using the complete combined dataset of GDSC drug response, methylation, mutation and expression.  Models will be evaluated and the best model selected for determining if the addition of some or all of the non-GDSC data improved model performance.

    The initial list of models includes:

    | 	Model	 | 	Brief description / notes	 | 	Library	 | 
    | 	--------	 | 	-----------	 | 	----------	 | 
    | 	***Continuous-target (regression)***	 | 		 | 		 | 
    | 	LGBMRegressor (baseline & optimized)	 | 	Gradient-boosted decision trees, native categorical support, fast on 100 k + rows	 | 	lightgbm	 | 
    | 	XGBRegressor	 | 	Complementary GBDT implementation; often rivals/edges out LightGBM on tabular data	 | 	xgboost	 | 
    | 	MLPRegressor	 | 	Feed-forward neural net (dense) ‚Äì serves as the neural-network baseline	 | 	scikit-learn / PyTorch-TabNet	 | 
    | 	***Binary-target (classification)***	 | 		 | 		 | 
    | 	DecisionTreeClassifier	 | 	Transparent baseline; matches your current pipeline	 | 	scikit-learn	 | 
    | 	RandomForestClassifier	 | 	Stronger ensemble; handles class imbalance with class-weights	 | 	scikit-learn	 | 

The baseline LGBMRegressor model achieved a 0.69 R^2 and Accuarcy of 0.72.

5. **Feature Addition Experiment**

    The following combination of data sets will be used to evaluate the contribution of methylation, mutation and expression to with the GDSC on model performance.

    | 	Condition	 | 	GDSC	 | 	Methylation (M)	 | 	Mutation (V)	 | 	Expression (E)	 | 
    | 	--------	 | 	-----------	 | 	--------	 | 	-----------	 | 	----------	 | 
    | 	Impact of GDSC only *	 | ‚úî | 		 | 		 | 		 | 
    | 	Impact of GDSC with M	 | ‚úî | ‚úî | 		 | 		 | 
    | 	Impact of GDSC with M + V	 | ‚úî | ‚úî |  ‚úî | 		 | 
    | 	Impact of GDSC with  M + E	 | ‚úî | ‚úî | 		 |  ‚úî | 
    | 	Impact of GDSC with  M + V + E	 | ‚úî |  ‚úî |  ‚úî  |  ‚úî | 
      * Used for Base Models and Selection of the Best Model				



    Feature selection uses `SelectFromModel` wrapped around LightGBM.
    Regression models are tuned with Optuna; classifiers use class-weights
    to counter residual imbalance after within-drug quartile binarisation.

## Evaluation Metrics
| Task | Primary metric | Secondary |
|------|----------------|-----------|
| Regression | **RMSE**, MAE, R¬≤, Spearman œÅ | Weighted RMSE (RMSE_w) |
| Classification | **AUROC**, PR-AUC | F1, Precision@Recall=0.8 |

  Regression predictions are additionally thresholded at each drug‚Äôs 25 %
  IC50 quantile to compute AUROC / PR-AUC, enabling direct comparison with
  binary classifiers.
